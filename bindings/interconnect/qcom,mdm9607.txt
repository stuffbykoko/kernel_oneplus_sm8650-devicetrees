QTI MDM9607 Network-On-Chip interconnect driver binding
-----------------------------------------------------------

Required properties :
- compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
			"qcom,mdm9x07-bimc",
			"qcom,mdm9x07-pcnoc",
- #interconnect-cells : should contain 1

reg : specifies the physical base address and size of registers
clocks : list of phandles and specifiers to all interconnect bus clocks
clock-names : clock names should include both "bus" and "bus_a"

The following are optional properties:
qcom,util-factor : Parameter that represents the DDR utilization factor
		to be used in aggregation scheme. It is represented as
		actual util-factor * 100.

Examples:

bimc: interconnect@401000 {
	reg = <0x401000 0x58000>;
	compatible = "qcom,mdm9x07-bimc";
	interconnect-cells = <1>;
};
